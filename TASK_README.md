# Digirati Front End Developer Tech Test

Your task is to build a small UI around the [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) API.

The UI must do the following:

- Allow the user to choose a region of the world (Asia, Europe, Oceania, etc)
- Once a region is chosen, allow the user to select a country within that region (e.g. if the user chooses Europe, they can then choose France, Germany and others, but not New Zealand)
- Once the user chooses a country, display the following information about that country:
  - As a page title, the countryâ€™s common name and flag, e.g. Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
  - Its official name, e.g. Federal Republic of Germany
  - Its native name(s), e.g. Deutschland
  - Its name(s) in Japanese, if available, e.g. ãƒ‰ã‚¤ãƒ„ or ãƒ‰ã‚¤ãƒ„é€£é‚¦å…±å’Œå›½
  - Its flag as an image
  - Its population density (population / area)

We like React, but use any libraries or frameworks you like.

Please also give us instructions on how we can see this UI in a web browser. Weâ€™ll be looking for code quality as well as usability and accessibility.
